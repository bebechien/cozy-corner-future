## 🌏 From Seoul to Tokyo

Hello! I am **bebechien**, coding the future from a corner of my room in Tokyo.

I dream of a "virtual world more real than reality". To build the world I dreamed of as a child, I have been rolling through the frontlines of technology—crossing boundaries between hardware, platforms, and AI.

This blog is my personal treasure chest, filled with interesting tech fragments I’ve picked up along that journey, and a space to chat with all of you.

## 👣 My Journey

In a nutshell, my career is defined by "**Geeking out with technology**".

* **Current @ Google DeepMind (Tokyo)**
  * *AI DevX Team*
  * The very place where AlphaGo shocked the world. Currently, I am working on innovating Developer Experience (DevX) and evangelizing AI technology. Finally, AI has started talking to us like a video game character.

* **2017 ~ 2023 @ Google**
  * *Stadia Technical Solutions Consultant*
  * "Enjoying games without downloading them?" To turn that crazy imagination into reality, I packed my bags in 2017 and moved to Japan. I ran fiercely on the frontlines of cloud gaming.

* **~ 2017 @ Sony Interactive Entertainment Korea**
  * *PlayStation System Software Engineer*
  * This is where I dedicated my 20s and early 30s - a total of 10 years of my youth. I hand-crafted the system software for the PlayStation that you stayed up all night enjoying, line by line.
