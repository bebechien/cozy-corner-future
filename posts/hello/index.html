There is a specific joy in taking difficult, complex concepts and breaking them down into soft, digestible pieces that anyone can understand.</p><p>I also enjoy drawing. Although my skills are strictly &ldquo;programmer art&rdquo; level, I believe a single clean diagram is often far more powerful than a hundred words.</p><p>And above all, I love coding. I truly cherish the process of creating something that actually <em>works</em> right at my fingertips.</p><p>I first dipped my toes into the massive wave of Generative AI back in 2023, right when Stable Diffusion was starting to take off. I had poked around game AI before that, but looking back, the shift that began then seems to be shaking the entire IT ecosystem to its roots.</p><p>At the time, I felt a strange thirst when looking at models trained primarily on Western art styles. So, I spent time <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/bebechien/shinyunbok_xl>painstakingly crafting datasets</a> and fell deeply into the <a href=https://civitai.com/user/bebechien>fun of teaching AI</a> the brushstrokes of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_Yunbok>Shin Yun-bok</a>, a painter from the Joseon Dynasty.</p><p>Then came a period where I felt infinitely small in front of the high-quality images pouring out so effortlessly. What sustained me through that overwhelming feeling was the realization that &ldquo;teaching a new style and setting the direction&rdquo; was still a human task.</p><p>A similar sense of helplessness arrived with writing. Watching models evolve from ChatGPT and Gemini, I witnessed AI’s writing skills quickly surpass my own. However, I realized that deciding <em>what</em> to write, bearing the weight of a piece published under my name, and finally putting the period at the end of the sentence is something only &ldquo;I&rdquo; can do. That sense of responsibility is something AI cannot take away.</p><p>Is coding any different? Although I still do a lot of the typing myself, my jaw drops at the speed of evolution every time a new model is released.</p><p>When it comes to writing or drawing, AI is already the superior player. So, a collaborative process has settled into my daily life: I throw out a rough draft, the AI polishes it smoothly, and I do the final review and adjustments. As the models get smarter, the parts I touch are becoming fewer and fewer. I have a hunch that coding will follow this exact process before long.</p><p>At an <a href=https://luma.com/6iyf5pca>AI Workshop</a> I attended yesterday, someone asked me a heavy question:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;What on earth should humans do in the future?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>As is the case now, even more things will be automated by AI in the future.</p><p>However, people like me will still want to make things ourselves. Even if we borrow the power of a tool as potent as AI, the starting point and the intention of that creation will still remain with the &ldquo;person.&rdquo;</p><p>There will be a clear distinction between what AI generates because it &ldquo;wants&rdquo; to (if ever), and what a human creates with specific intent. The value will likely be assessed differently, too.</p><p>Isn&rsquo;t it similar to the variety of choices we have when we need a chair?</p><p>Sure, you can pay money and buy a comfortable, finished product. But some enjoy the process of buying parts from IKEA and assembling them; others buy the tools and cut the lumber to build from scratch; and some even choose the primitive labor of carving wood, stitch by stitch, by hand.</p><p>Just as we pay different prices for factory-made goods and artisanal handicrafts today, I believe the &ldquo;us&rdquo; of the future will continue to live on, assigning different meanings based on the &ldquo;process&rdquo; and &ldquo;values&rdquo; embedded in the result.</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2026 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
